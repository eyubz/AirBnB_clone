# AirBnB clone the console
- The project encompasses the creation of base classes essential for the entire system, including BaseModel, User, State, Place, Review, and Amenity. Additionally, it incorporates the implementation of a basic command interpreter to manage these objects efficiently. The interpreter allows for operations such as creation, display, deletion, and updating of objects, as well as managing the storage of class instances using a simple file system. This initiative establishes the foundational elements necessary for the project's functionality and organization.
- You can start the command interpretor by running ./console.py
- You can use it to manage all the objects related to the whole application.
- example
   - ./console.py
   - create BaseModel
   - This command will create a BaseModel object and stores it on the file returning the id of the object
